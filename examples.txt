Stella rose and went to the window, and stood looking into the night.
The moonlight was glinting the river in the distance, and falling in great masses upon the lawn at her feet. Half unconsciously she opened the window, and stepping out, found herself in a small garden,beautifully kept and fragrant with violets;
her love for flowers was a passion, and she stepped on to the path in search of them.
The path led in zigzag fashion to a little wooden gate, by which the garden was entered from the lane.
Stella found some violets, and looking about in search of further treasure store, saw a bunch of lilac blossom growing in the lane side.
